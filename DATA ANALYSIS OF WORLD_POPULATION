##2. Which country has the least number of people?

SELECT COUNTRY , POPULATION FROM WORLD_POPULATION WHERE POPULATION =(SELECT MIN(POPULATION) FROM WORLD_POPULATION) ;

##3. Which country is witnessing the highest population growth?

SELECT * FROM WORLD_POPULATION ORDER BY NET_CHANGE DESC LIMIT 10 ;

##4. Which country has an extraordinary number for the population?

SELECT * FROM WORLD_POPULATION ORDER BY NET_CHANGE LIMIT 10 ;

##5. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
